  Makefile:     to compile example_thread, server, and client, just
                type "make" or "make all".  Make sure you read
                this Makefile to understand how the various libraries
                get linked into the various executables.

  common.[c|h]: some code that is useful to both the server and client

  server.c:     the source code for the single-threaded server

  client.c:     the source code for a single-threaded test client

  example_thread.c:  an example multithreaded program that uses pthreads

  threadpool.[c|h]: the code you will modify to implement a thread pool

  threadpool_test.c: some sample code that invokes a threadpool

  lib: a directory containing a library that shields you from
                  needing to understand how to create and manipulate
                  network sockets.  Feel free to read the code in here
                  if you're curious, though.

SERVER TEST PROCEDURE:
1. Run the server
  ./server 4324 POOLSIZE NUMROW
2. In zsh, I used this command to run test
  repeat TIMES {./client localhost 4322 &}.
2.1. Provided run_test.sh, this script will do the same to the command above.
  ./run_test SERVER PORT NUMCLIENTS
3. SIGINT on server, will stop the server.
