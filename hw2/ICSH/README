The job data structure comes from GNU.org and other websites.

Constraints:
1. This shell does not support complex command like bash
such as "./program < input > output" yet.

2. This shell cannot do cd.

3. Rarely, the commands will not be found if the user input too many commands.

4. When you kill with SIGKILL on a process, the jobs are oblivious to know that the process is killed, leaving a zombie job.

5. Maximum number of jobs is 20, it can be increased in the source code.
